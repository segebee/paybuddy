#PayBuddy

PayBuddy is an app that helps web3 professionals in Africa receive payments in fiat or crypto for work done.

Currently, receiving payments and converting to local currencies in Africa is stressful due to regulations, fragmented systems and numerous borders/language barriers.

We are building a beautiful, better and easier to use banking app for a decentralized future. Users can receive payments, convert to local currencies, invest and earn returns and also access credit and other banking facilities
